# About topoflow-diversions-fraction-method-csdms

Home: http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model_help:TopoFlow-Diversions

Package license: Apache

Summary: The DiversionsFractionMethod component is a part of the
spatially distributed hydrologic model TopoFlow. TopoFlow supports
three different types of flow diversions: sources, sinks, and
canals. Sources are point locations, such as natural springs, where
water enters the watershed. Sinks are point locations where water
leaves the watershed. Canals are man-made reaches such as tunnels or
irrigation ditches that transport water from one point to another,
typically without following the natural gradient of the terrain that
is indicated by the DEM. The upstream end of a canal is essentially
a sink and the downstream end a source.
